*Hey everybody!*

After a long time being dormant, I'm again here to grow and be better.

Since we started 8 months ago this project has grown from a personal bot to a bot, that lots of people use every day. It was long way, with a lot of fails, but Pockebot still works only because you use it!

Special thanks to translation enthusiasts, now @Pockebot supports:
- English
- Russian
- Italian
- Portuguese

And today, I became *opensource*. What does it mean for you?
1. Pockebot will be more stable and secure, since everybody can check how it works.
2. Pockebot will develop faster, since everybody can participate.

How you can help bot development?

- if you can write code, pull requests are welcome at our [github repository](https://github.com/Fillll/pockebot).
- You can always improve translation, just contact in [support group](https://telegram.me/pocket_bot_support_en).
- And of cource you can [donate some bucks](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=rMS6dfhvC5IDsVC-aNMtneQmLwcyVNIc3zox79GXkDnUTW0QygwlCqRbwye&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d333dc9aadeed3fe0b5b299d55fd35542) for server :)
